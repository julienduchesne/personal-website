Here are some (non-work related and fun) projects that I sometimes work on in my limited spare time

## Mastermind Phaser

A fun departure from the usual DevOps/Golang/Python/Backend stuff I do at work. I set out to learn how to use the [Phaser Javascript game framework](https://phaser.io/). I improved my knowledge about a lot of things doing this:
* Phaser
* Jest Test Framework
* ESLint
* The Mastermind game itself

## Rust Code Challenges

Why not play around with some Rust UI libraries while doing Advent of Code? This project contains my solutions to Advent of Code with a small terminal frontend in front of it

## Cursive TUI (Text-based UI) Frontend

## What next?

* Solving other years of Advent of Code/Project Euler/Whatever I can find and looks fun. Doesn't have to be in Rust, I'd also like to try some interop libraries
* Adding a [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) frontend. I'd like to try out Rust's API development experience
