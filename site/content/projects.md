Here are some (non-work related and fun) projects that I sometimes work on in my limited spare time

## Mastermind Phaser

A fun departure from the usual DevOps/Golang/Python/Backend stuff I do at work. I set out to learn how to use the [Phaser Javascript game framework](https://phaser.io/). I improved my knowledge about a lot of things doing this:
* Phaser
* Jest Test Framework
* ESLint
* The Mastermind game itself
