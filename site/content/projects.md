Here are some (non-work related and fun) projects that I sometimes work on in my limited spare time

## Mastermind Phaser

A fun departure from the usual DevOps/Golang/Python/Backend stuff I do at work. I set out to learn how to use the [Phaser Javascript game framework](https://phaser.io/). I improved my knowledge about a lot of things doing this:
* Phaser
* Jest Test Framework
* ESLint
* The Mastermind game itself

## Code Challenges

An embarrassingly complex showcase of challenge solutions. This serves as a playground to try out new languages. A new group of challenges can be added by adding a new independent module (microservice), it can therefore be implemented in any language

Current modules:

* [Cursive](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive) TUI (Text-based UI) frontend

* Advent of Code 2020 solved with Rust
* Advent of Code 2019 solved with Go

Future modules:

* Advent of Code 2018 solved with Python
