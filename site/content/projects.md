Here are some (non-work related and fun) projects that I sometimes work on in my limited spare time

## Mastermind Phaser (**WIP**)

A fun departure from the usual DevOps/Golang/Python/Backend stuff I do at work. I set out to learn how to use the [Phaser Javascript game framework](https://phaser.io/). This is multiple levels of unknown for me but, so far, I'm having a lot of fun
